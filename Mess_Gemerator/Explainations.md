This program will generate a string with length determined by the user at first, then generate another string at random for the same length. The program will check if the second generated string is similar as the first one, if not, it keeps generate the third one.....until it finds the exact same string that being generated at the first time. It's basically useless, but running this program may help understanding how much work needs to be done for cracking somebody's password.
